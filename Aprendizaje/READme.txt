To try by yourself you must start the server using the following code:

"python -m streamlit run app.py"

You can also change the following line to change between different image type (spiral and wave):

"base_path = 'spiral'"

I wont probably work with your own drawings due to the small sample size from which it has learned.
Nonetheless it works just fine using the testing images.
